Phase 1.5 extension — Labeled ground-truth events + fade validation.

Two things this script does:

1. Writes bvmt_data/labeled_events.csv — combining the original documented
   cases from the earlier market-conduct research (Tuninvest, UADH) with the newly
   researched delisting cases (GIF, Electrostar/LSTR, Servicom/SERVI, MIP,
   SOPAT). This becomes the reference set every detector you build from
   here on should be evaluated against, instead of ad-hoc spot checks.

2. Computes a quantitative FADE SCORE for each event: average volume in
   the 12 months immediately before the event date, divided by average
   volume in the 12 months before THAT. A score well below 1.0 means
   trading activity was genuinely fading into the event (the GIF/LSTR/
   SERVI bankruptcy pattern). A score near or above 1.0 means activity
   stayed normal or even increased right up to the event (the UADH and,
   hypothesis, SOPAT pattern — though for very different reasons: UADH
   because the market didn't know, SOPAT because the company was healthy
   and just got bought out).

This script reuses the load_data and monthly_spotlight functions from
decay_detector.py.

Usage:
    python src/validation/validate_distress_cases.py
